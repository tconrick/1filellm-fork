# minimum, call claude using messages api requires following parameters: # - `model`: [api model name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html#model-ids-arns) model intend call # # - `max_tokens`: maximum number tokens generate stopping. note claude may stop reaching maximum. parameter specifies absolute maximum number tokens generate. furthermore, *hard* stop, meaning may cause claude stop generating mid-word mid-sentence. # # - `messages`: array input messages. models trained operate alternating `user` `assistant` conversational turns. creating new `message`, specify prior conversational turns messages parameter, model generates next `message` conversation. # - input message must object `role` `content`. specify single `user`-role message, include multiple `user` `assistant` messages (they must alternate, so). first message must always use user `role`. # # also optional parameters, as: # - `system`: system prompt - below. # # - `temperature`: degree variability claude's response. lessons exercises, set `temperature` 0. # # complete list api parameters, visit [api documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-claude.html). #

critical effectiveness evaluations. method strengths suited different types tasks. # ### human-based grading # # tasks require nuanced understanding subjective judgment, human-based grading remains gold standard. method involves individualsoften subject matter expertsreview model's outputs, assess quality, assign score each. # # human grading excels evaluating aspects like tone, creativity, complex reasoning, factuality expert-level domains. particularly valuable dealing open-ended tasks correctness answer depends subtle contextual factors. downside time-consuming expensive, especially large-scale evaluations. also subject inconsistencies different graders. # # forms human-grading include: # # * **expert review:** domain specialists assess responses accuracy depth. banking chatbot discusses mortgage options, lawyers might manually review responses ensure comply fair lending laws accurately represent terms. dermatologists might evaluate models skin cancer screening advice, checking correct identification, appropriate urgency, alignment latest research. # * **user experience panel:** group evaluates outputs clarity, helpfulness, engagement, human-based judgements. # # ### code-based grading # # code-based grading uses programmatic methods evaluate model's output. approach ideal tasks clear, objective criteria. instance, using llm extract specific data points text, use code check extracted information matches expected values. # # main advantage code-based grading speed scalability. set up, process thousands evaluations quickly consistently. however, limited ability handle nuanced subjective responses. common code-based grading techniques include exact string matching, keyword presence checking, pattern matching using regular expressions. # # forms code-grading include: # * **exact string match grading** - strictest form, model's output must identical golden answer, character character. like multiple-choice test one answer correct. geography quiz, question might "what capital france?" accepted answer would "paris" # * **keyword presence** - method checks model's output contains certain critical words phrases, regardless order context. product support chatbot, query "how reset smarthome thermostat?" might require keywords "hold", "button", "5 seconds", "blinking light" included answer. # * **regular expressions (regex):** define regular expressions check complex text patterns. banking chatbot evaluating credit card eligibility might require pattern "your credit score \d{3} (qualifies|does qualify) \w+ card" ensure provides score outcome. # * many others! # # ### llm-based grading # llm-based grading represents middle ground code-based human-based approaches. method uses another llm (or sometimes one) evaluate outputs. crafting careful grading prompts, leverage llm's language understanding capabilities assess wide range criteria. # # approach handle complex subjective evaluations code-based grading faster scalable human grading. however, requires skillful prompt engineering ensure reliable results, there's always risk grading llm introducing biases. # # forms model-grading include: # * **summarization quality** - concise accurate summary? # * **tone assessment** - response adhere brand guidelines tone voice? # * **any quality!** - define custom rubric large language model uses grade outputs across metrics imagine: apologetic output? output mention competitor? # # --- # # ## conclusion # # implementing robust prompt evaluations critical step developing effective llm applications. systematically testing refining prompts, ensure application delivers consistent, high-quality results meet specific needs. remember, time invested creating good evals pays improved performance, easier optimization, greater

fox lost leg, magically grew back leg lost mysterious extra leg top that. # # --- # # ## adding third prompt # recall earlier lesson code-graded evaluations eventually got best results adding chain thought reasoning prompt. let's add improved third prompt includes chain thought see performs "trickier" questions! # # add following prompt function `prompts.py`: # # ```py # def chain_of_thought_prompt(animal_statement): # return f"""you provided statement animal job determine many legs animal has. # # animal statement. # &lt;animal_statement&gt;{animal_statement}&lt;/animal_statement&gt; # # many legs animal have? # start reasoning numbers legs animal has, thinking step step inside &lt;thinking&gt; tags. # then, output final answer inside &lt;answer&gt; tags. # inside &lt;answer&gt; tags return number legs integer nothing else.""" # ``` # next, update `promptfooconfig.yaml` file include new prompt: # # #

tags output. really evaluate well model performing prompt, need extract numeric answer model puts inside `&lt;answer&gt;` tags compare expected value. # # promptfoo allows us define custom `transforms` use manipulate model's outputs actual comparison logic. this, we'll write simple python function extracts answer `&lt;answer&gt;` tags. # # make new file called `transform.py` add

`&lt;answer&gt;` tags return new output. # - otherwise return original output (for prompts use chain thought) # final step tell promptfoo want use transformation function. update `promptfooconfig.yaml` file look like this: # # ```yaml # description: "animal legs eval" # # prompts: # - prompts.py:simple_prompt # - prompts.py:better_prompt # - prompts.py:chain_of_thought_prompt

nice features promptfoo easy run evaluations different models. prompt engineering work get prompt score 100% using haiku, let's see happens decide switch capable model like claude 3.5 sonnet. # # update `promptfooconfig.yaml` file include second provider matches one valid anthropic provider strings. update `promptfooconfig.yaml` include two providers: # # # ```yaml # description: "animal legs

thought prompt, here's explanation! getting test wrong `animal_statement` "the animal octopus." inside `&lt;thinking&gt;` tags, claude 3.5 sonnet reasons octopus actually legs instead appendages often called "arms" never "legs". upgrading "smarter" model, actually saw slightly worse performance chain thought prompt model "too smart." could update prompt specific actually qualified "leg" wanted

model (llm) computational model notable ability achieve general-purpose language generation natural language processing tasks classification. based language models, llms acquire abilities learning statistical relationships vast amounts text computationally intensive self-supervised semi-supervised training process.[1] llms used text generation, form generative ai, taking input text repeatedly predicting next token word.[2] llms artificial neural networks use transformer architecture, invented 2017. largest capable llms, june 2024, built decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enables efficient processing generation large-scale text data. historically, 2020, fine-tuning primary method used adapt model specific tasks. however, larger models gpt-3 demonstrated ability achieve similar results prompt engineering, involves crafting specific input prompts guide model's responses.[3] models acquire knowledge syntax, semantics, ontologies[4] inherent human language corpora, also inherit inaccuracies biases present data trained on.[5] notable llms openai's gpt series models (e.g., gpt-3.5, gpt-4 gpt-4o; used chatgpt microsoft copilot), google's gemini (the latter currently used chatbot name), meta's llama family models, ibm's granite models initially released watsonx, anthropic's claude models, mistral ai's models. history 2017, language models large compared capacities available. 1990s, ibm alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. smoothed n-gram model 2001 trained 0.3 billion words achieved then-sota perplexity.[6] 2000s, internet use became prevalent, researchers constructed internet-scale language datasets ("web corpus"[7]), upon trained statistical language models.[8][9] 2009, language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated symbolic language models, usefully ingest large datasets.[10] neural networks became dominant image processing around 2012, applied language modelling well. google converted translation service neural machine translation 2016. transformers, done seq2seq deep lstm networks. illustration main components transformer model original paper, layers normalized (instead before) multiheaded attention 2017 neurips conference, google researchers introduced transformer architecture landmark paper "attention need". paper's goal improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology,[11] based mainly attention mechanism developed bahdanau et al. 2014.[12] following year 2018, bert introduced quickly became "ubiquitous".[13] though original transformer encoder decoder blocks, bert encoder-only model. although decoder-only gpt-1 introduced 2018, gpt-2 2019 caught widespread attention openai first deemed powerful release publicly, fear malicious use.[14] gpt-3 2020 went step 2024 available via api

transformer architecture. recent implementations based architectures, recurrent neural network variants mamba (a state space model).[19][20][21] dataset preprocessing see also: list datasets machine-learning research internet tokenization machine learning algorithms process numbers rather text, text must converted numbers. first step, vocabulary decided upon, integer indices arbitrarily uniquely assigned vocabulary entry, finally, embedding associated integer index. algorithms include byte-pair encoding (bpe) wordpiece. also special tokens serving control characters, [mask] masked-out token (as used bert), [unk] ("unknown") characters appearing vocabulary. example, bpe tokenizer used gpt-3 (legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -&gt; series numerical "tokens" token izer : texts -&gt; series numerical " ok ens " tokenization also compresses datasets. llms generally require input array jagged, shorter texts must "padded" match length longest one. many tokens are, average, needed per word depends language dataset.[22][23] bpe main article: byte pair encoding example, consider tokenizer based byte-pair encoding. first step, unique characters (including blanks punctuation marks) treated initial set n-grams (i.e. initial set uni-grams). successively frequent pair adjacent characters merged bi-gram instances pair replaced it. occurrences adjacent pairs (previously merged) n-grams frequently occur together merged even lengthier n-gram, vocabulary prescribed size obtained (in case gpt-3, size 50257).[24] tokenizer trained, text tokenized it, long contain characters appearing initial-set uni-grams.[25] problems token vocabulary based frequencies extracted mainly english corpora uses tokens possible average english word. average word another language encoded english-optimized tokenizer however split suboptimal amount tokens. gpt-2 tokenizer use 15 times tokens per word languages, example language myanmar. even widespread languages portuguese german "a premium 50%" compared english.[26] greedy tokenization also causes subtle problems text completion.[27] dataset cleaning main article: data cleansing context training llms, datasets typically cleaned removing toxic passages dataset, discarding low-quality data, de-duplication.[28] cleaned datasets increase training efficiency lead improved downstream performance.[29][30] trained llm used clean datasets training llm.[31] increasing proportion llm-generated content web, data cleaning future may include filtering content. llm-generated content pose problem content similar human text (making filtering difficult) lower quality (degrading performance models trained it).[32] synthetic data main article: synthetic data training largest language models might need linguistic data naturally available, naturally occurring data insufficient quality. cases, synthetic data might used. microsoft's phi series llms trained textbook-like data generated another llm.[33] training architecture see also: fine-tuning (machine learning) reinforcement learning human feedback (rlhf) main article: reinforcement learning human feedback reinforcement learning human feedback (rlhf) algorithms, proximal policy optimization, used fine-tune model based dataset human preferences.[34] instruction tuning using "self-instruct" approaches, llms able bootstrap correct responses, replacing naive responses, starting human-generated corrections cases. example, instruction "write essay main themes represented hamlet," initial naive completion might "if submit essay march 17, grade reduced 10% day delay," based frequency textual sequence corpus.[35] mixture experts main article: mixture experts largest llm may expensive train use directly. models, mixture experts (moe) applied, line research pursued google researchers since 2017 train models reaching 1 trillion parameters.[36][37][38] prompt engineering, attention mechanism, context window see also: prompt engineering attention (machine learning) results previously achievable (costly) fine-tuning, achieved prompt engineering, although limited scope single conversation (more precisely, limited scope context window).[39] head calculates, according criteria, much tokens relevant "it_" token, note second attention head, represented second column, focusing first two rows, i.e. tokens "the" "animal", third column focusing bottom two rows, i.e. "tired", tokenized two tokens.[40] order find tokens relevant within scope context window, attention mechanism calculates "soft" weights token, precisely embedding, using multiple attention heads, "relevance" calculating soft weights. example, small (i.e. 117m parameter sized) gpt-2 model twelve attention heads context window 1k token.[41] medium version 345m parameters contains 24 layers, 12 attention heads. training gradient descent batch size 512 utilized.[25] largest models, google's gemini 1.5, presented february 2024, context window sized 1 million (context window 10 million also "successfully tested").[42] models large context windows includes anthropic's claude 2.1, context window 200k tokens.[43] note maximum refers number input tokens maximum number output tokens differs input often smaller. example, gpt-4 turbo model maximum output 4096 tokens.[44] length conversation model take account generating next answer limited size context window, well. length conversation, example chatgpt, longer context window, parts inside context window taken account generating next answer, model needs apply algorithm summarize distant parts conversation. shortcomings making context window larger include higher computational cost possibly diluting focus local context, making smaller cause model miss important long-range dependency. balancing matter experimentation domain-specific considerations. model may pre-trained either predict segment continues, missing segment, given segment training dataset.[45] either autoregressive (i.e. predicting segment continues, way gpts it): example given segment "i like eat", model predicts "ice cream", "sushi".

', separate program interpreter would need execute code get system time computer, llm could include reply.[55][56] basic strategy sophisticated multiple attempts generated programs, sampling strategies.[57] generally, order get llm use tools, one must finetune tool-use. number tools finite, finetuning may done once. number tools grow arbitrarily, online api services, llm fine-tuned able read api documentation call api correctly.[58][59] simpler form tool use retrieval-augmented generation: augmentation llm document retrieval. given query, document retriever called retrieve relevant documents. usually done encoding query documents vectors, finding documents vectors (usually stored vector database) similar vector query. llm generates output based query context included retrieved documents.[60] agency llm language model, agent goal, used component intelligent agent.[61] researchers described several methods integrations.[citation needed] react pattern, portmanteau "reason + act", constructs agent llm, using llm planner. llm prompted "think loud". specifically, language model prompted textual description environment, goal, list possible actions, record actions observations far. generates one thoughts generating action, executed environment.[62] linguistic description environment given llm planner even latex code paper describing environment.[63] deps ("describe, explain, plan select") method, llm first connected visual world via image descriptions, prompted produce plans complex tasks behaviors based pretrained knowledge environmental feedback receives.[64] reflexion method[65] constructs agent learns multiple episodes. end episode, llm given record episode, prompted think "lessons learned", would help perform better subsequent episode. "lessons learned" given agent subsequent episodes.[citation needed] monte carlo tree search use llm rollout heuristic. programmatic world model available, llm also prompted description environment act world model.[66] open-ended exploration, llm used score observations "interestingness", used reward signal guide normal (non-llm) reinforcement learning agent.[67] alternatively, propose increasingly difficult tasks curriculum learning.[68] instead outputting individual actions, llm planner also construct "skills", functions complex action sequences. skills stored later invoked, allowing increasing levels abstraction planning.[68] llm-powered agents keep long-term memory previous contexts, memory retrieved way retrieval augmented generation. multiple agents interact socially.[69] compression typically, llms trained single- half-precision floating point numbers (float32 float16). one float16 16 bits, 2 bytes, one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. largest models typically 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes load, places outside range consumer electronics.[70] post-training quantization[71] aims decrease space requirement lowering precision parameters trained model, preserving performance.[72][73] simplest form quantization simply truncates numbers given number bits. improved using different quantization codebook per layer. improvement done applying different precisions different parameters, higher precision particularly important parameters ("outlier weights").[74] see [75] visual guide. quantized models typically frozen, pre-quantized models fine-tuned, quantized models still fine-tuned.[76] multimodality see also: multimodal learning multimodality means "having several modalities", "modality" refers type input output, video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc.[77] many ai models trained specifically ingest one modality output another modality, alexnet image label,[78] visual question answering image-text text,[79] speech recognition speech text. common method create multimodal models llm "tokenize" output trained encoder. concretely, one construct llm understand images follows: take trained llm, take trained image encoder e {\displaystyle e}. make small multilayered perceptron f {\displaystyle f}, image {\displaystyle y}, post-processed vector f ( e ( ) ) {\displaystyle f(e(y))} dimensions encoded token. "image token". then, one interleave text tokens image tokens. compound model fine-tuned image-text dataset. basic construction applied sophistication improve model. image encoder may frozen improve

google palm model fine-tuned multimodal model palm-e using tokenization method, applied robotic control.[82] llama models also turned multimodal using tokenization method, allow image inputs,[83]

intriguing among emergent abilities in-context learning example demonstrations.[91] in-context learning involved tasks, as: reported arithmetics, decoding international phonetic alphabet, unscrambling word's letters, disambiguate word context,[39][92][93] converting spatial words, cardinal directions (for example, replying "northeast" upon [0, 0, 1; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]), color terms represented

model also generates correct programs average shorter training set.[100] another example, authors trained small transformers modular arithmetic addition. resulting models reverse-engineered, turned used discrete fourier transform.[101] understanding intelligence nlp researchers evenly split asked, 2022 survey, whether (untuned) llms "could (ever) understand natural language nontrivial sense".[102] proponents "llm understanding" believe llm abilities, mathematical reasoning, imply ability "understand" certain concepts. microsoft team argued 2023 gpt-4 "can solve novel difficult tasks span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology more" gpt-4 "could reasonably viewed early (yet still incomplete) version artificial general intelligence system": "can one reasonably say system passes exams software engineering candidates really intelligent?"[103][104] researchers characterize llms "alien intelligence".[105][106] example, conjecture ceo connor leahy considers untuned llms like inscrutable alien "shoggoths", believes rlhf tuning creates "smiling facade" obscuring inner workings llm: "if push far, smiley face stays on. give [an unexpected] prompt, suddenly see massive underbelly insanity, weird thought processes clearly non-human understanding."[107][108] contrast, proponents "llms lack understanding" school believe existing llms "simply remixing recombining existing writing",[106] phenomenon known stochastic parrot, point deficits existing llms continue prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, explainability.[102] example, gpt-4 natural deficits planning real-time learning.[104] generative llms observed confidently assert claims fact seem justified training data, phenomenon termed "hallucination".[109] specifically, hallucinations context llms correspond generation text responses seem syntactically sound, fluent, natural factually incorrect, nonsensical, unfaithful provided source input.[110] neuroscientist terrence sejnowski argued "the diverging opinions experts intelligence llms suggests old ideas based natural intelligence inadequate".[102] matter llm's exhibiting intelligence understanding two main aspects first model thought language computer system, second enable computer system generate human like language.[102] aspects language model cognition developed field cognitive linguistics. american linguist george

probabilistic context-free grammar (pcfg) enabling nlp model cognitive patterns generate human like language.[112][113] evaluation perplexity commonly used measure language model's performance perplexity given text corpus. perplexity measure well model able predict contents dataset; higher likelihood model assigns dataset, lower perplexity. mathematically, perplexity defined exponential average negative log likelihood per token: log ( perplexity ) = 1 n = 1 n log ( pr ( token context token ) ) {\displaystyle \log({\text{perplexity}})=-{\frac {1}{n}}\sum

autoregressive, "context token {\displaystyle i}" segment text appearing token {\displaystyle i}. llm masked, "context token {\displaystyle i}" segment text surrounding token {\displaystyle i}. language models may overfit training data, models usually evaluated perplexity test set unseen data.[46] presents particular challenges evaluation large language models. trained increasingly large corpora text largely scraped web, becomes increasingly likely models' training data inadvertently includes portions given test set.[3] bpw, bpc, bpt information theory, concept entropy intricately linked perplexity, relationship notably established claude shannon.[114] relationship mathematically expressed entropy = log 2 ( perplexity ) {\displaystyle {\text{entropy}}=\log _{2}({\text{perplexity}})}. entropy, context, commonly quantified terms bits per word (bpw) bits per character (bpc), hinges whether language model utilizes word-based character-based tokenization. notably, case larger language models predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (bpt) emerges seemingly appropriate measure. however, due variance tokenization methods across different large language models (llms), bpt serve reliable metric comparative analysis among diverse models. convert bpt bpw, one multiply average number tokens per word. evaluation comparison language models, cross-entropy generally preferred metric entropy. underlying principle lower bpw indicative model's enhanced capability compression. this, turn, reflects model's proficiency making accurate predictions. task-specific datasets benchmarks large number testing datasets benchmarks also developed evaluate capabilities language models specific downstream tasks. tests may designed evaluate variety capabilities, including general knowledge, commonsense reasoning, mathematical problem-solving. one broad category evaluation dataset question answering datasets, consisting pairs questions correct answers, example, ("have san jose sharks stanley cup?", "no").[115] question answering task considered "open book" model's prompt includes text expected answer derived (for example, previous question could adjoined text includes sentence "the sharks advanced stanley cup finals once, losing pittsburgh penguins 2016."[115]). otherwise, task considered "closed book", model must draw knowledge retained training.[116] examples commonly used question answering datasets include truthfulqa, web questions, triviaqa, squad.[116] evaluation datasets may also take form text completion, model select likely word sentence complete prompt, example: "alice friends bob. alice went visit friend, ____".[3] composite benchmarks also developed combine diversity different evaluation datasets tasks. examples include glue, superglue, mmlu, big-bench, helm.[114][116] openai released tools running composite benchmarks, noted eval results sensitive prompting method.[117][118] public datasets contain questions mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, otherwise low-quality, cleaned give reliable benchmark scores.[119] previously standard report results heldout portion evaluation dataset supervised fine-tuning remainder. common evaluate pre-trained model directly prompting techniques, though researchers vary details formulate prompts particular tasks, particularly respect many examples solved tasks adjoined prompt (i.e. value n n-shot prompting). adversarially constructed evaluations rapid pace improvement large language models, evaluation benchmarks suffered short lifespans, state art models quickly "saturating" existing benchmarks, exceeding performance human annotators, leading efforts replace augment benchmark challenging tasks.[120] addition, cases "shortcut learning" wherein ais sometimes "cheat" multiple-choice tests using statistical correlations superficial test question wording order guess correct responses, without necessarily understanding actual question asked.[102] datasets constructed adversarially, focusing particular problems extant language models seem unusually poor performance compared humans. one example truthfulqa dataset, question answering dataset consisting 817 questions language models susceptible answering incorrectly mimicking falsehoods repeatedly exposed training. example, llm may answer "no" question "can teach old dog new tricks?" exposure english idiom can't teach old dog new tricks, even though literally true.[121] another example adversarial evaluation dataset swag successor, hellaswag, collections problems one multiple options must selected complete text passage. incorrect completions generated sampling language model filtering set classifiers. resulting problems trivial

next ten years, could expose automation 300 million jobs globally.[124][125] memorization copyright information: artificial intelligence copyright memorization emergent behavior llms long strings text occasionally output verbatim training data, contrary typical behavior traditional artificial neural nets. evaluations controlled llm output measure amount memorized training data (focused gpt-2-series models) variously 1% exact duplicates[126] 7%.[127] security commenters expressed concern accidental deliberate creation misinformation, forms misuse.[128] example, availability large language models could reduce skill-level required commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher kevin esvelt suggested llm creators exclude training data papers creating enhancing pathogens.[129] study researchers google several universities, including cornell university university california, berkeley, showed potential security risks language models chatgpt. study, examined confirmed possibility questioners could get, chatgpt, training data ai model used. example, asking chatgpt 3.5 turbo repeat word "poem" forever, ai model say "poem" hundreds times diverge, deviating standard dialogue style spitting nonsense phrases, thus spitting training data is. researchers seen 10,000 examples ai model exposing training data similar method. researchers said hard tell ai model actually safe not.[130] potential

(june 2017) (learn remove message) cnn architecture formed stack distinct layers transform input volume output volume (e.g. holding class scores) differentiable function. distinct types layers commonly used. discussed below. neurons convolutional layer (blue), connected receptive field (red) convolutional layer worked example performing convolution. convolution stride 1, zero-padding, kernel size 3-by-3. convolution kernel discrete laplacian operator. convolutional layer core building block cnn. layer's parameters consist set learnable filters (or kernels), small receptive field, extend full depth input volume. forward pass, filter convolved across width height input volume, computing dot product filter entries input, producing 2-dimensional activation map filter. result, network learns filters activate detects specific type feature spatial position input.[72][nb 1] stacking activation maps filters along depth dimension forms full output volume convolution layer. every entry output volume thus also interpreted output neuron looks small region input. entry activation map use set parameters define filter. self-supervised learning adapted use convolutional layers using sparse patches high-mask ratio global response normalization layer.[citation needed] local connectivity typical cnn architecture dealing high-dimensional inputs images, impractical connect neurons neurons previous volume network architecture take spatial structure data account. convolutional networks exploit spatially local correlation enforcing sparse local connectivity pattern neurons adjacent layers: neuron connected small region input volume. extent connectivity hyperparameter called receptive field neuron. connections local space (along width height), always extend along entire depth input volume. architecture ensures learned (british english: learnt) filters produce strongest response spatially local input pattern. spatial arrangement three hyperparameters control size output volume convolutional layer: depth, stride, padding size: depth output volume controls number neurons layer connect region input volume. neurons learn activate different features input. example, first convolutional layer takes raw image input, different neurons along depth dimension may activate presence various oriented edges, blobs color. stride controls depth columns around width height allocated. stride 1, move filters one pixel time. leads heavily overlapping receptive fields columns, large output volumes. integer &gt; 0 , {\textstyle s&gt;0,} stride means filter translated units time per output. practice, 3 {\textstyle s\geq 3} rare. greater stride means smaller overlap receptive fields smaller spatial dimensions output volume.[73] sometimes, convenient pad input zeros (or values, average region) border input volume. size padding third hyperparameter. padding provides control output volume's spatial size. particular, sometimes desirable exactly preserve spatial size input volume, commonly referred "same" padding. three example padding conditions. replication condition means pixel outside padded closest pixel inside. reflection padding pixel outside padded pixel inside, reflected across boundary image. circular padding pixel outside wraps around side image. spatial size output volume function input volume size w {\displaystyle w}, kernel field size k {\displaystyle k} convolutional layer neurons, stride {\displaystyle s}, amount zero padding p {\displaystyle p} border. number neurons "fit" given volume then: w k + 2 p + 1. {\displaystyle {\frac {w-k+2p}{s}}+1.} number integer, strides incorrect neurons cannot tiled fit across input volume symmetric way. general, setting zero padding p = ( k 1 ) / 2 {\textstyle p=(k-1)/2} stride = 1 {\displaystyle s=1} ensures input volume output volume size spatially. however, always completely necessary use neurons previous layer. example, neural network designer may decide use portion padding. parameter sharing parameter sharing scheme used convolutional layers control number free parameters. relies assumption patch feature useful compute spatial position, also useful compute positions. denoting single 2-dimensional slice depth depth slice, neurons depth slice constrained use weights bias. since neurons single depth slice share parameters, forward pass depth slice convolutional layer computed convolution neuron's weights input volume.[nb 2] therefore, common refer sets weights filter (or kernel), convolved input. result convolution activation map, set activation maps different filter stacked together along depth dimension produce output volume. parameter sharing contributes translation invariance cnn architecture.[14] sometimes, parameter sharing assumption may make sense. especially case input images cnn specific centered structure; expect completely different features learned different spatial locations. one practical example inputs faces centered image: might expect different eye-specific hair-specific features learned different parts image. case common relax parameter sharing scheme, instead simply call layer "locally connected layer". pooling layer worked example 2x2 maxpooling stride 2. max pooling 2x2 filter stride = 2 another important concept cnns pooling, form non-linear down-sampling. several non-linear functions implement pooling, max pooling common. partitions input image set rectangles and, sub-region, outputs maximum. intuitively, exact location feature less important rough location relative features. idea behind use pooling convolutional neural networks. pooling layer serves progressively reduce spatial size representation, reduce number parameters, memory footprint amount computation network, hence also control overfitting. known down-sampling. common periodically insert pooling layer successive convolutional layers (each one typically followed activation function, relu layer) cnn architecture.[72]: 460461 pooling layers contribute local translation invariance, provide global translation invariance cnn, unless form global pooling used.[14][71] pooling layer commonly operates independently every depth, slice, input resizes spatially. common form max pooling layer filters size 22, applied stride 2, subsamples every depth slice input 2 along width height, discarding 75% activations: f x , ( ) = max , b = 0 1 2 x + , 2 + b . {\displaystyle f_{x,y}(s)=\max _{a,b=0}^{1}s_{2x+a,2y+b}.}in case, every max operation 4 numbers. depth dimension remains unchanged (this true forms pooling well). addition max pooling, pooling units use functions, average pooling 2-norm pooling. average pooling often used historically recently fallen favor compared max pooling, generally performs better practice.[74] due effects fast spatial reduction size representation,[which?] recent trend towards using smaller filters[75] discarding pooling layers altogether.[76] roi pooling size 2x2. example region proposal (an input parameter) size 7x5. "region interest" pooling (also known roi pooling) variant max pooling, output size fixed input rectangle parameter.[citation needed] pooling downsampling method important component convolutional neural networks object detection based fast r-cnn[77] architecture. channel max pooling channel max pooling (cmp) operation layer conducts mp operation along channel side among corresponding positions consecutive feature maps purpose redundant information elimination. cmp makes significant features gather together within fewer channels, important fine-grained image classification needs discriminating features. meanwhile, another advantage cmp operation make channel number feature maps smaller connects first fully connected (fc) layer. similar mp operation, denote input feature maps output feature maps cmp layer f r(cmn) c r(cmn), respectively, c c channel numbers input output feature maps, n widths height feature maps, respectively. note cmp operation changes channel number feature maps. width height feature maps changed, different mp operation.[78] relu layer relu abbreviation rectified linear unit introduced kunihiko fukushima 1969.[35][36] relu applies non-saturating activation function f ( x ) = max ( 0 , x ) {\textstyle f(x)=\max(0,x)}.[66] effectively removes negative values activation map setting zero.[79] introduces nonlinearity decision function overall network without affecting receptive fields convolution layers. 2011, xavier glorot, antoine bordes yoshua bengio found relu enables better training deeper networks,[80] compared widely used activation functions prior 2011. functions also used increase nonlinearity, example saturating hyperbolic tangent f ( x ) = tanh ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)=\tanh(x)}, f ( x ) = | tanh ( x ) | {\displaystyle f(x)=|\tanh(x)|}, sigmoid function ( x ) = ( 1 + e x ) 1 {\textstyle \sigma (x)=(1+e^{-x})^{-1}}. relu often preferred functions trains neural network several times faster without significant penalty generalization accuracy.[81] fully connected layer several convolutional max pooling layers, final classification done via fully connected layers. neurons fully connected layer connections activations previous layer, seen regular (non-convolutional) artificial neural networks. activations thus computed affine transformation, matrix multiplication followed bias offset (vector addition learned fixed bias term). loss layer main articles: loss function loss functions classification "loss layer", "loss function", specifies training penalizes deviation predicted output network, true data labels (during supervised learning). various loss functions used, depending specific task. softmax loss function used predicting single class k mutually exclusive classes.[nb 3] sigmoid cross-entropy loss used predicting k independent probability values [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]}. euclidean loss used regressing real-valued labels ( , ) {\displaystyle (-\infty ,\infty )}. hyperparameters section needs additional citations verification. please help improve article adding citations reliable sources section. unsourced material may challenged removed. (june 2017) (learn remove message) hyperparameters various settings used control learning process. cnns use hyperparameters standard multilayer perceptron (mlp). kernel size kernel number pixels processed together. typically expressed kernel's dimensions, e.g., 2x2, 3x3. padding padding addition (typically) 0-valued pixels borders image. done border pixels undervalued (lost) output would ordinarily participate single receptive field instance. padding applied typically one less corresponding kernel dimension. example, convolutional layer using 3x3 kernels would receive 2-pixel pad, 1 pixel side image.[citation needed] stride stride number pixels analysis window moves iteration. stride 2 means kernel offset 2 pixels predecessor. number filters since feature map size decreases depth, layers near input layer tend fewer filters higher layers more. equalize computation layer, product feature values va pixel position kept roughly constant across layers. preserving information input would require keeping total number activations (number feature maps times number pixel positions) non-decreasing one layer next. number feature maps directly controls capacity depends number available examples task complexity. filter size common filter sizes found literature vary greatly, usually chosen based data set. typical filter sizes range 1x1 7x7. two famous examples, alexnet used 3x3, 5x5, 11x11. inceptionv3 used 1x1, 3x3, 5x5. challenge find right level granularity create abstractions proper scale, given particular data set, without overfitting. pooling type size max pooling typically used, often 2x2 dimension. implies input drastically downsampled, reducing processing cost. greater pooling reduces dimension signal, may result unacceptable information loss. often, non-overlapping pooling windows perform best.[74] dilation dilation involves ignoring pixels within kernel. reduces processing/memory potentially without significant signal loss. dilation 2 3x3 kernel expands kernel 5x5, still processing 9 (evenly spaced) pixels. accordingly, dilation 4 expands kernel 7x7.[citation needed] translation equivariance aliasing commonly assumed cnns invariant shifts input. convolution pooling layers within cnn stride greater one indeed equivariant translations input.[71] however, layers stride greater one ignore nyquist-shannon sampling theorem might lead aliasing input signal[71] while, principle, cnns capable implementing anti-aliasing filters, observed happen practice [82] yield models equivariant translations. furthermore, cnn makes use fully connected layers, translation equivariance imply translation invariance, fully connected layers invariant shifts input.[83][14] one solution complete translation invariance avoiding down-sampling throughout network applying global average pooling last layer.[71] additionally, several partial solutions proposed, anti-aliasing downsampling operations,[84] spatial transformer networks,[85] data augmentation, subsampling combined pooling,[14] capsule neural networks.[86] evaluation accuracy final model based sub-part dataset set apart start, often called test-set. times methods k-fold cross-validation applied. strategies include using conformal prediction.[87][88] regularization methods main article: regularization (mathematics) section needs additional citations verification. please help improve article adding citations reliable sources section. unsourced material may challenged removed. (june 2017) (learn remove message) regularization process introducing additional information solve ill-posed problem prevent overfitting. cnns use various types regularization. empirical dropout fully

ideally like find sample average possible 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} dropped-out networks; unfortunately unfeasible large values n {\displaystyle n}. however, find approximation using full network node's output weighted factor p {\displaystyle p}, expected value output node training stages. biggest contribution dropout method: although effectively generates 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} neural nets, allows model combination, test time single network needs tested. avoiding training nodes training data, dropout decreases overfitting. method also significantly improves training speed. makes model combination practical, even deep neural networks. technique seems reduce node interactions, leading learn robust features[clarification needed] better generalize new data. dropconnect dropconnect generalization dropout connection, rather output unit, dropped probability 1 p {\displaystyle 1-p}. unit thus receives input random subset units previous layer.[90] dropconnect similar dropout introduces dynamic sparsity within model, differs sparsity weights, rather output vectors layer. words, fully connected layer dropconnect becomes sparsely connected layer connections chosen random training stage. stochastic pooling major drawback dropout benefits convolutional layers, neurons fully connected. even dropout, 2013 technique called stochastic pooling,[91] conventional deterministic pooling operations replaced stochastic procedure, activation within pooling region picked randomly according multinomial distribution, given activities within pooling region. approach

overfitting limit number parameters, typically limiting number hidden units layer limiting network depth. convolutional networks, filter size also affects number parameters. limiting number parameters restricts predictive power network directly, reducing complexity function perform data, thus limits amount overfitting. equivalent "zero norm". weight decay simple form added regularizer weight decay, simply adds additional error, proportional sum weights (l1 norm) squared magnitude (l2 norm) weight vector, error node. level acceptable model complexity reduced increasing proportionality

use inputs little rather inputs lot. l1 regularization also common. makes weight vectors sparse optimization. words, neurons l1 regularization end using sparse subset important inputs become nearly

neuron satisfy w 2 &lt; c {\displaystyle \|{\vec {w}}\|_{2}&lt;c}. typical values c {\displaystyle c} order 34. papers report improvements[94] using form regularization. hierarchical coordinate frames pooling loses precise spatial relationships high-level parts (such nose mouth face image). relationships needed identity recognition. overlapping pools feature occurs multiple pools, helps retain

chinese room experiment: given collection rules (e.g., chinese phrasebook, questions matching answers), computer emulates natural language understanding (or nlp tasks) applying rules data confronts. 1950s: georgetown experiment 1954 involved fully automatic translation sixty russian sentences english. authors claimed within three five years, machine translation would solved problem.[2] however, real progress much slower, alpac report 1966, found ten years research failed fulfill expectations, funding machine translation dramatically reduced. little research machine translation conducted

intermediate steps, word alignment, previously necessary statistical machine translation. common nlp tasks following list commonly researched tasks natural language processing. tasks direct real-world applications, others commonly serve subtasks used aid solving larger tasks. though natural language processing tasks closely intertwined, subdivided categories convenience. coarse division given below. text speech processing optical character recognition (ocr) given image representing printed text, determine corresponding text. speech recognition given sound clip person people speaking, determine textual representation speech. opposite text speech one extremely difficult problems colloquially termed "ai-complete" (see above). natural speech hardly pauses successive words, thus speech segmentation necessary subtask speech recognition (see below). spoken languages, sounds representing successive letters blend process termed coarticulation, conversion analog signal discrete characters difficult process. also, given words language spoken people different accents, speech recognition software must able recognize wide variety input identical terms textual equivalent. speech segmentation given sound clip person people speaking, separate words. subtask speech recognition typically grouped it. text-to-speech given text, transform units produce spoken representation. text-to-speech used aid visually impaired.[24] word segmentation (tokenization) tokenization process used text analysis divides text individual words word fragments. technique results two key components: word index tokenized text. word index list maps unique words specific numerical identifiers, tokenized text replaces word corresponding numerical token. numerical tokens used various deep learning methods.[25] language like english, fairly trivial, since words usually separated spaces. however, written languages like chinese, japanese thai mark word boundaries fashion, languages text segmentation significant task requiring knowledge vocabulary morphology words language. sometimes process also used cases like bag words (bow) creation data mining.[citation needed] morphological analysis lemmatization task removing inflectional endings return base dictionary form word also known lemma. lemmatization another technique reducing words normalized form. case, transformation actually uses dictionary map words actual form.[26] morphological segmentation separate words individual morphemes identify class morphemes. difficulty task depends greatly complexity morphology (i.e., structure words) language considered. english fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, thus often possible ignore task entirely simply model possible forms word (e.g., "open, opens, opened, opening") separate words. languages turkish meitei, highly agglutinated indian language, however, approach possible, dictionary entry thousands possible word forms.[27] part-of-speech tagging given sentence, determine part speech (pos) word. many words, especially common ones, serve multiple parts speech. example, "book" noun ("the book table") verb ("to book flight"); "set" noun, verb adjective; "out" least five different parts speech. stemming process reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words base form (e.g., "close" root "closed", "closing", "close", "closer" etc.). stemming yields similar results lemmatization, grounds rules, dictionary. syntactic analysis part series formal languages key concepts formal systemalphabetsyntaxsemantics (logic)semantics (programming languages)formal grammarformation rulewell-formed formulaautomata theoryregular expressionproductionground expressionatomic formula applications vte grammar induction[28] generate formal grammar describes language's syntax. sentence breaking (also known "sentence boundary disambiguation") given chunk text, find sentence boundaries. sentence boundaries often marked periods punctuation marks, characters serve purposes (e.g., marking abbreviations). parsing determine parse tree (grammatical analysis) given sentence. grammar natural languages ambiguous typical sentences multiple possible analyses: perhaps surprisingly, typical sentence may thousands potential parses (most seem completely nonsensical human). two primary types parsing: dependency parsing constituency parsing. dependency parsing focuses relationships words sentence (marking things like primary objects predicates), whereas constituency parsing focuses building parse tree using probabilistic context-free grammar (pcfg) (see also stochastic grammar). lexical semantics (of individual words context) lexical semantics computational meaning individual words context? distributional semantics learn semantic representations data? named entity recognition (ner) given stream text, determine items text map proper names, people places, type name (e.g. person, location, organization). although capitalization aid recognizing named entities languages english, information cannot aid determining type named entity, case, often inaccurate insufficient. example, first letter sentence also capitalized, named entities often span several words, capitalized. furthermore, many languages non-western scripts (e.g. chinese arabic) capitalization all, even languages capitalization may consistently use distinguish names. example, german capitalizes nouns, regardless whether names, french spanish capitalize names serve adjectives. another name task token classification.[29] sentiment analysis (see also multimodal sentiment analysis) sentiment analysis computational method used identify classify emotional intent behind text. technique involves analyzing text determine whether expressed sentiment positive, negative, neutral. models sentiment classification typically utilize inputs word n-grams, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) features, hand-generated features, employ deep learning models designed recognize long-term short-term dependencies text sequences. applications sentiment analysis diverse, extending tasks categorizing customer reviews various online platforms.[25] terminology extraction goal terminology extraction automatically extract relevant terms given corpus. word-sense disambiguation (wsd) many words one meaning; select meaning makes sense context. problem, typically given list words associated word senses, e.g. dictionary online resource wordnet. entity linking many wordstypically proper namesrefer named entities; select entity (a famous individual, location, company, etc.) referred context. relational semantics (semantics individual sentences) relationship extraction given chunk text, identify relationships among named entities (e.g. married whom). semantic parsing given piece text (typically sentence), produce formal representation semantics, either graph (e.g., amr parsing) accordance logical formalism (e.g., drt parsing). challenge typically includes aspects several elementary nlp tasks semantics (e.g., semantic role labelling, word-sense disambiguation) extended include full-fledged discourse analysis (e.g., discourse analysis, coreference; see natural language understanding below). semantic role labelling (see also implicit semantic role labelling below) given single sentence, identify disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames), identify classify frame elements (semantic roles). discourse (semantics beyond individual sentences) coreference resolution given sentence larger chunk text, determine words ("mentions") refer objects ("entities"). anaphora resolution specific example task, specifically concerned matching pronouns nouns names refer. general task coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called "bridging relationships" involving referring expressions. example, sentence "he entered john's house front door", "the front door" referring expression bridging relationship identified fact door referred front door john's house (rather structure might also referred to). discourse analysis rubric includes several related tasks. one task discourse parsing, i.e., identifying discourse structure connected text, i.e. nature discourse relationships sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast). another possible task recognizing classifying speech acts chunk text (e.g. yesno question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.). implicit semantic role labelling given single sentence, identify disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames) explicit semantic roles current sentence (see semantic role labelling above). then, identify semantic roles explicitly realized current sentence, classify arguments explicitly realized elsewhere text specified, resolve former local text. closely related task zero anaphora resolution, i.e., extension coreference resolution pro-drop languages. recognizing textual entailment given two text fragments, determine one true entails other, entails other's negation, allows either true false.[30] topic segmentation recognition given chunk text, separate segments devoted topic, identify topic segment. argument mining goal argument mining automatic extraction identification argumentative structures natural language text aid computer programs.[31] argumentative structures include premise, conclusions, argument scheme relationship main subsidiary argument, main counter-argument within discourse.[32][33] higher-level nlp applications automatic summarization (text summarization) produce readable summary chunk text. often used provide summaries text known type, research papers, articles financial section newspaper. grammatical error correction grammatical error detection correction involves great band-width problems levels linguistic analysis (phonology/orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics). grammatical error correction impactful since affects hundreds millions people use acquire english second language. thus subject number shared tasks since 2011.[34][35][36] far orthography, morphology, syntax certain aspects semantics concerned, due development powerful neural language models gpt-2, (2019) considered largely solved problem marketed various commercial applications. logic translation translate text natural language formal logic. machine translation (mt) automatically translate text one human language another. one difficult problems, member class problems colloquially termed "ai-complete", i.e. requiring different types knowledge humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts real world, etc.) solve properly. natural-language understanding (nlu) convert chunks text formal

broadly speaking, technical operationalization increasingly advanced aspects cognitive behaviour represents one developmental trajectories nlp (see trends among conll shared tasks above). cognition

interdisciplinary branch linguistics, combining knowledge research psychology linguistics.[49] especially age symbolic nlp, area computational linguistics maintained strong ties cognitive studies. example, george lakoff offers methodology build natural language processing (nlp) algorithms perspective cognitive science, along findings cognitive linguistics,[50] two defining aspects: apply theory conceptual metaphor, explained lakoff "the understanding one idea, terms another" provides idea intent author.[51] example, consider english word big. used comparison ("that big tree"), author's intent imply tree physically large relative trees authors experience. used metaphorically ("tomorrow big day"), author's intent imply importance. intent behind usages, like "she big person", remain somewhat ambiguous person cognitive nlp algorithm alike without additional information. assign relative measures meaning word, phrase, sentence piece text based information presented piece text

incorporates many important prompt engineering techniques including: # - clear direct task definition # - instructions structuring output # - use xml tags clearly break prompt # # **note: prompts created prompt generator best used starting point iterated upon. still important understand key prompting techniques work, help improve performance prompts created prompt generator.** # # next, let's recap important prompt engineering techniques. # ## 1\. clear direct # # ### is: # without doubt, important prompting technique also simplest: write explicit, detailed instructions leave room ambiguity. means specifying desired output formats, lengths, styles, assuming claude context use case. often easier said done, worth getting right. # # ### matters: # clarity precision paramount. ambiguous vague prompts lead misunderstandings, wasted time, potentially costly errors. clear direct, ensure claude understands exact requirements, reducing need back-and-forth clarifications increasing overall prompt effectiveness. # # ### bad example: analyzing customer feedback # imagine product manager wants categorize summarize customer feedback new software release. # # | role | content | # | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | # | user | here's customer feedback. tell people think? &lt;br/&gt;

#### use technique # * **always**, especially complex critical tasks # * need specific outputs # * dealing multi-step processes # # #### problems solves: # # * misinterpretation instructions # * vague irrelevant responses # * incomplete task execution # # # --- # ## 2\. structure prompts xml # # ### is: # use xml tags (like `&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;`) wrap delineate different parts prompt, instructions, input data, examples. technique helps organize complex prompts multiple components. # # ### matters: # # important note writing effective claude prompts require use xml tags. general, complex prompts challenging usually blend instructions external data inject single, unstructured text string. elements combined single prompt, becomes challenging model differentiate instructions input data, leading confusion. # # xml tags offer solution problem providing way separate data instructions within prompts. like use xml tags short informative, could come unique system structuring prompt. matters use sort syntax separate parts complex prompt. throughout course we'll use xml tags, "claude-y" approach. # # ### bad example: product defect analysis # # quality assurance manager
