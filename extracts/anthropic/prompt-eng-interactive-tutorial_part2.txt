# ## Lesson
# 
# **Giving Claude examples of how you want it to behave (or how you want it not to behave) is extremely effective** for:
# - Getting the right answer
# - Getting the answer in the right format
# 
# This sort of prompting is also called "**few shot prompting**". You might also encounter the phrase "zero-shot" or "n-shot" or "one-shot". The number of "shots" refers to how many examples are used within the prompt.

# ### Examples
# 
# Pretend you're a developer trying to build a "parent bot" that responds to questions from kids. **Claude's default response is quite formal and robotic**. This is going to break a child's heart.

# In[ ]:


# Prompt
PROMPT = "Will Santa bring me presents on Christmas?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))


# You could take the time to describe your desired tone, but it's much easier just to **give Claude a few examples of ideal responses**.

# In[ ]:


# Prompt
PROMPT = """Please complete the conversation by writing the next line, speaking as "A".
Q: Is the tooth fairy real?
A: Of course, sweetie. Wrap up your tooth and put it under your pillow tonight. There might be something waiting for you in the morning.
Q: Will Santa bring me presents on Christmas?"""

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))


# In the following formatting example, we could walk Claude step by step through a set of formatting instructions on how to extract names and professions and then format them exactly the way we want, or we could just **provide Claude with some correctly-formatted examples and Claude can extrapolate from there**. Note the `&lt;individuals&gt;` in the `assistant` turn to start Claude off on the right foot.

# ## Lesson
# 
# Some bad news: **Claude sometimes "hallucinates" and makes claims that are untrue or unjustified**. The good news: there are techniques you can use to minimize hallucinations.
# 				
# Below, we'll go over a few of these techniques, namely:
# - Giving Claude the option to say it doesn't know the answer to a question
# - Asking Claude to find evidence before answering
# 
# However, **there are many methods to avoid hallucinations**, including many of the techniques you've already learned in this course. If Claude hallucinates, experiment with multiple techniques to get Claude to increase its accuracy.

# ### Examples
# 
# Here is a question about general factual knowledge in answer to which **Claude hallucinates several large hippos because it's trying to be as helpful as possible**.

# In[ ]:


# Prompt
PROMPT = "Who is the heaviest hippo of all time?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))


# A solution we can try here is to "**give Claude an out**" ‚Äî tell Claude that it's OK for it to decline to answer, or to only answer if it actually knows the answer with certainty.

# In[ ]:


# Prompt
PROMPT = "Who is the heaviest hippo of all time? Only answer if you know the answer with certainty."

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))


# In the prompt below, we give Claude a long document containing some "distractor information" that is almost but not quite relevant to the user's question. **Without prompting help, Claude falls for the distractor information** and gives an incorrect "hallucinated" answer as to the size of Matterport's subscriber base as of May 31, 2020.
# 
# **Note:** As you'll learn later in the next chapter, **it's best practice to have the question at the bottom *after* any text or document**, but we put it at the top here to make the prompt easier to read. Feel free to double click on the prompt cell to get the full prompt text (it's very long!).

&lt;document&gt;
Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023
Item 1. Business
Our Company
Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.
Since its founding in 2011, Matterport‚Äôs pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform‚Äôs innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.
The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (‚ÄúCAGR‚Äù) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.
Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport‚Äôs spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport‚Äôs structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.
We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù), machine learning (‚ÄúML‚Äù) and deep learning (‚ÄúDL‚Äù) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.

Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.
For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.

As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (‚ÄúAEC‚Äù), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.
We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform‚Äôs software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.
With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.
We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport‚Äôs unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.

Our Spatial Data Platform
Overview
Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.
As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber‚Äôs hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.
Key elements of our spatial data platform include:
‚Ä¢Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (‚Äú2D‚Äù) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.
‚Ä¢Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.
‚Ä¢Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans‚Äîsubscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.
Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.
Ubiquitous Capture
Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.
The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3‚Äôs ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.

Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights
Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.
In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.

Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023
Item 1. Business
Our Company
Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.
Since its founding in 2011, Matterport‚Äôs pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform‚Äôs innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.
The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (‚ÄúCAGR‚Äù) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.
Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport‚Äôs spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport‚Äôs structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.
We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù), machine learning (‚ÄúML‚Äù) and deep learning (‚ÄúDL‚Äù) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.

Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.
For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.

As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (‚ÄúAEC‚Äù), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.
We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform‚Äôs software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.
With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.
We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport‚Äôs unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.

Our Spatial Data Platform
Overview
Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.
As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber‚Äôs hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.
Key elements of our spatial data platform include:
‚Ä¢Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (‚Äú2D‚Äù) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.
‚Ä¢Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.
‚Ä¢Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans‚Äîsubscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.
Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.

Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights
Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.
In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.
Extensible Platform Ecosystem
Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (‚ÄúAPIs‚Äù) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market. We intend to continue to deploy a broad set of workflow integrations with our partners and their subscribers to promote an integrated Matterport solution across our target markets. We are also developing a third-party software marketplace to extend the power of our spatial data platform with easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access Matterport software add-ons. The marketplace enables developers to build new applications and spatial data mining tools, enhance the Matterport 3D experience, and create new productivity and property management tools that supplement our core offerings. These value-added capabilities created by third-party developers enable a scalable new revenue stream, with Matterport sharing the subscription and services revenue from each add-on that is deployed to subscribers through the online marketplace. The network effects of our platform ecosystem contributes to the growth of our business, and we believe that it will continue to bolster future growth by enhancing subscriber stickiness and user engagement.

Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023
Item 1. Business
Our Company
Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.
Since its founding in 2011, Matterport‚Äôs pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform‚Äôs innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.
The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (‚ÄúCAGR‚Äù) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.
Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport‚Äôs spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport‚Äôs structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.
We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù), machine learning (‚ÄúML‚Äù) and deep learning (‚ÄúDL‚Äù) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.

Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.
For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.

As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (‚ÄúAEC‚Äù), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.
We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform‚Äôs software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.
With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.
We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport‚Äôs unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.

Our Spatial Data Platform
Overview
Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.
As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber‚Äôs hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.
Key elements of our spatial data platform include:
‚Ä¢Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (‚Äú2D‚Äù) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.
‚Ä¢Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.
‚Ä¢Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans‚Äîsubscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.
Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.
Ubiquitous Capture
Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.
The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3‚Äôs ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.
‚Ä¢360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.
‚Ä¢LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.
‚Ä¢Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport‚Äôs smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.
Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)
With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.

The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights
Matterport Runs on Cortex
Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.
Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport‚Äôs datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.
‚Ä¢Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport‚Äôs rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex‚Äôs evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.
‚Ä¢Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex‚Äôs neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex‚Äôs capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive ‚Äúpreview‚Äù of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.
‚Ä¢Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.
‚Ä¢Advanced image processing: Matterport‚Äôs computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport‚Äôs software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.
Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights
Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.
In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.
Extensible Platform Ecosystem
Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (‚ÄúAPIs‚Äù) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market. We intend to continue to deploy a broad set of workflow integrations with our partners and their subscribers to promote an integrated Matterport solution across our target markets. We are also developing a third-party software marketplace to extend the power of our spatial data platform with easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access Matterport software add-ons. The marketplace enables developers to build new applications and spatial data mining tools, enhance the Matterport 3D experience, and create new productivity and property management tools that supplement our core offerings. These value-added capabilities created by third-party developers enable a scalable new revenue stream, with Matterport sharing the subscription and services revenue from each add-on that is deployed to subscribers through the online marketplace.

Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023
Item 1. Business
Our Company
Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.
Since its founding in 2011, Matterport‚Äôs pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform‚Äôs innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.
The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (‚ÄúCAGR‚Äù) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.
Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport‚Äôs spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport‚Äôs structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.
We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù), machine learning (‚ÄúML‚Äù) and deep learning (‚ÄúDL‚Äù) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.

Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.
For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.

As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (‚ÄúAEC‚Äù), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.
We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform‚Äôs software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.
With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.
We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport‚Äôs unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.

Our Spatial Data Platform
Overview
Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.
As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber‚Äôs hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.
Key elements of our spatial data platform include:
‚Ä¢Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (‚Äú2D‚Äù) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.
‚Ä¢Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.
‚Ä¢Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans‚Äîsubscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.
Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.
Ubiquitous Capture
Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.
The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3‚Äôs ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.
‚Ä¢360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.
‚Ä¢LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.
‚Ä¢Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport‚Äôs smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.
Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)
With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.

The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights
Matterport Runs on Cortex
Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.
Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport‚Äôs datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.
‚Ä¢Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport‚Äôs rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex‚Äôs evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.
‚Ä¢Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex‚Äôs neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex‚Äôs capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive ‚Äúpreview‚Äù of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.
‚Ä¢Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.
‚Ä¢Advanced image processing: Matterport‚Äôs computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport‚Äôs software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.
Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights
Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.
In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.
Extensible Platform Ecosystem
Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (‚ÄúAPIs‚Äù) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market. We intend to continue to deploy a broad set of workflow integrations with our partners and their subscribers to promote an integrated Matterport solution across our target markets.

‚Ä¢Broad patent portfolio supporting 10 years of R&amp;D and innovation. As of December 31, 2022, we had 54 issued and 37 pending patent applications. Our success is based on almost 10 years of focus on innovation. Innovation has been at the center of Matterport, and we will continue to prioritize our investments in R&amp;D to further our market leading position.
‚Ä¢Superior capture technology. Matterport‚Äôs capture technology platform is a software framework that enables support for a wide variety of capture devices required to create a Matterport digital twin of a building or space.
This includes support for LiDAR cameras, 360 cameras, smartphones, Matterport Axis and the Matterport Pro2 and Pro3 cameras. The Pro2 camera was foundational to our spatial data advantage, and we have expanded that advantage with an array of Matterport-enabled third-party capture devices. In August 2022, we launched and began shipment of our Pro3 Camera along with major updates to our industry-leading digital twin cloud platform. The Matterport Pro3 Camera is an advanced 3D capture device, which includes faster boot time, swappable batteries, and a lighter design. The Pro3 camera can perform both indoors and outdoors and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Along with our Pro2 Camera, we expect that future sales of our Pro3 Camera will continue to drive increased adoption of our solutions. Matterport is democratizing the 3D capture experience, making high-fidelity and high-accuracy 3D digital twins readily available for any building type and any subscriber need in the property life cycle. While there are other 3D capture solution providers, very few can produce true, dimensionally accurate 3D results, and fewer still can automatically create a final product in photorealistic 3D, and at global scale. This expansive capture technology offering would not be possible without our rich spatial data library available to train the AI-powered Cortex engine to automatically generate accurate digital twins from photos captured with a smartphone or 360 camera.

Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023
Item 1. Business
Our Company
Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.
Since its founding in 2011, Matterport‚Äôs pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform‚Äôs innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.
The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (‚ÄúCAGR‚Äù) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.
Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport‚Äôs spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport‚Äôs structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.
We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù), machine learning (‚ÄúML‚Äù) and deep learning (‚ÄúDL‚Äù) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.

Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.
For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.

As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (‚ÄúAEC‚Äù), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.
We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform‚Äôs software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.
With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.
We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport‚Äôs unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade.

Our Spatial Data Platform
Overview
Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.
As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber‚Äôs hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.
Key elements of our spatial data platform include:
‚Ä¢Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (‚Äú2D‚Äù) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.
‚Ä¢Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.
‚Ä¢Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans‚Äîsubscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.
Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.
Ubiquitous Capture
Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.
The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3‚Äôs ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.
‚Ä¢Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.
‚Ä¢360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.
‚Ä¢LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.
‚Ä¢Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport‚Äôs smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.
Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)
With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.

The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights
Matterport Runs on Cortex
Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.
Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport‚Äôs datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.
‚Ä¢Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport‚Äôs rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex‚Äôs evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.
‚Ä¢Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex‚Äôs neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex‚Äôs capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive ‚Äúpreview‚Äù of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.
‚Ä¢Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.
‚Ä¢Advanced image processing: Matterport‚Äôs computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport‚Äôs software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.
Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights
Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.
In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.
Extensible Platform Ecosystem
Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (‚ÄúAPIs‚Äù) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market. We intend to continue to deploy a broad set of workflow integrations with our partners and their subscribers to promote an integrated Matterport solution across our target markets. We are also developing a third-party software marketplace to extend the power of our spatial data platform with easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access Matterport software add-ons. The marketplace enables developers to build new applications and spatial data mining tools, enhance the Matterport 3D experience, and create new productivity and property management tools that supplement our core offerings. These value-added capabilities created by third-party developers enable a scalable new revenue stream, with Matterport sharing the subscription and services revenue from each add-on that is deployed to subscribers through the online marketplace. The network effects of our platform ecosystem contributes to the growth of our business, and we believe that it will continue to bolster future growth by enhancing subscriber stickiness and user engagement.

# ## Lesson
# 
# Congratulations on making it to the last chapter! Now time to put everything together and learn how to **create unique and complex prompts**. 
# 
# Below, you will be using a **guided structure that we recommend for complex prompts**. In latter parts of this chapter, we will show you some industry-specific prompts and explain how those prompts are similarly structured.
# 
# **Note:** **Not all prompts need every element of the following complex structure**. We encourage you to play around with and include or disinclude elements and see how it affects Claude's response. It is usually **best to use many prompt elements to get your prompt working first, then refine and slim down your prompt afterward**.

# ### Example - Career Coach Chatbot
# 
# The following structure combines multiple prompt engineering elements and is a good starting point for complex prompts. **The ordering matters for some elements**, not for others. We will note when best practices indicate ordering matters, but in general, **if you stick to this ordering, it will be a good start to a stellar prompt**.
# 
# For the following example, we will be building a prompt for a controlled roleplay wherein Claude takes on a situational role with a specific task. Our goal is to prompt Claude to act as a friendly career coach.
# 
# Read then run the cell below to compile the various prompt elements into one whole prompt.

- Human resources specialist - An understanding of group dynamics and organizational behavior from sociology is applicable to careers in human resources.

The animal health industry became caught up in a number of patent and trademark lawsuits during the past year. In 1994, Barclay Slocum obtained patents for the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy procedure, which is used in the treatment of dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, and for the devices used in the procedure. During 2006, Slocum Enterprises filed a patent infringement suit against New Generation Devices, arguing that the Unity Cruciate Plate manufactured by New Generation infringed on the patent for the Slocum TPLO plate. However, the court never reached a decision on the issue of patent infringement, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction on the basis of the small number of plates sold in the state in which the case was filed and the information provided on a Web site maintained by Slocum Enterprises. Other patent battles waged during 2006 concerned the use of laser technology for onychectomy in cats, pet identification chips, pig vaccines, and pet ‚Äúdeshedding‚Äù tools.

In Canada, the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association brought suit against a nonveterinarian, claiming that he engaged in cutting or otherwise removing hooks from horses' teeth and floating horses' teeth with power and manual tools, provided advice and diagnoses in return for a fee, and held himself out as being qualified and willing to provide treatment with respect to these activities. The court held that the intention of the legislature in passing the Veterinary Profession Act was the protection of the public and animals and further held that monopolistic statutes serve the purpose of protecting the public. In addition, the court concluded that dentistry, at its core, relates to the health of the teeth and gums; is distinct from cosmetic and other types of care of animals; and, therefore, falls under the definition of the practice of veterinary medicine. The nonveterinarian was enjoined from providing services without a veterinarian supervising the procedures.

The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast of the United States during 2005, spurred changes to the way animals are treated during natural disasters. In 2006, Hawaii, Louisiana, and New Hampshire all enacted laws that address issues regarding the care of animals during disasters, such as providing shelters for pets and allowing service animals to be kept with the people they serve. In addition, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act during 2006, which requires state and local emergency preparedness authorities to include in their evacuation plans information on how they will accommodate household pets and service animals in case of a disaster. California passed a law that will require its Office of Emergency Services, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies involved with disaster response preparation to develop a plan for the needs of service animals, livestock, equids, and household pets in the event of a disaster or major emergency.

# ### Exercise 9.1 - Financial Services Chatbot
# Prompts within the financial profession can also be quite complex due to reasons similar to legal prompts. Here's an exercise for a financial use-case, wherein Claude is used to **analyze tax information and answer questions**. Just like with the legal services example, we've changed around the ordering of a few elements, as our solution prompt makes more sense with a different flow (however, other structures would also work).
# 
# We suggest you read through the variable content (in this case, `{QUESTION}` and `{TAX_CODE}`) to understand what content Claude is expected to work with. Be sure to reference `{QUESTION}` and `{TAX_CODE}` directly in your prompt somewhere (using f-string syntax like in the other examples) so that the actual variable content can be substituted in.
# 
# Fill in the prompt element fields with content that match the description and the examples you've seen in the preceding examples of complex prompts. Once you have filled out all the prompt elements that you want to fill out, run the cell to see the concatenated prompt as well as Claude's response.
# 
# Remember that prompt engineering is rarely purely formulaic, especially for large and complex prompts! It's important to develop test cases and **try a variety of prompts and prompt structures to see what works best for each situation**. Note that if you *do* change the ordering of the prompt elements, you should also remember to change the ordering of the concatenaton in the `COMBINE ELEMENTS` section.

(a)General rule
If, in connection with the performance of services, property is transferred to any person other than the person for whom such services are performed, the excess of‚Äî
(1)the fair market value of such property (determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse) at the first time the rights of the person having the beneficial interest in such property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier, over
(2)the amount (if any) paid for such property,
shall be included in the gross income of the person who performed such services in the first taxable year in which the rights of the person having the beneficial interest in such property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever is applicable. The preceding sentence shall not apply if such person sells or otherwise disposes of such property in an arm‚Äôs length transaction before his rights in such property become transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
(b)Election to include in gross income in year of transfer
(1)In general
Any person who performs services in connection with which property is transferred to any person may elect to include in his gross income for the taxable year in which such property is transferred, the excess of‚Äî
(A)the fair market value of such property at the time of transfer (determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse), over
(B)the amount (if any) paid for such property.
If such election is made, subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to the transfer of such property, and if such property is subsequently forfeited, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of such forfeiture.
(2)Election
An election under paragraph (1) with respect to any transfer of property shall be made in such manner as the Secretary prescribes and shall be made not later than 30 days after the date of such transfer. Such election may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.

(c)Special rules
For purposes of this section‚Äî
(1)Substantial risk of forfeiture
The rights of a person in property are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if such person‚Äôs rights to full enjoyment of such property are conditioned upon the future performance of substantial services by any individual.

(2)Transferability of property
The rights of a person in property are transferable only if the rights in such property of any transferee are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

(3)Sales which may give rise to suit under section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
So long as the sale of property at a profit could subject a person to suit under section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such person‚Äôs rights in such property are‚Äî
(A)subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, and
(B)not transferable.
(4)For purposes of determining an individual‚Äôs basis in property transferred in connection with the performance of services, rules similar to the rules of section 72(w) shall apply.
(d)Certain restrictions which will never lapse
(1)Valuation
In the case of property subject to a restriction which by its terms will never lapse, and which allows the transferee to sell such property only at a price determined under a formula, the price so determined shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the property unless established to the contrary by the Secretary, and the burden of proof shall be on the Secretary with respect to such value.

(2)Cancellation
If, in the case of property subject to a restriction which by its terms will never lapse, the restriction is canceled, then, unless the taxpayer establishes‚Äî
(A)that such cancellation was not compensatory, and
(B)that the person, if any, who would be allowed a deduction if the cancellation were treated as compensatory, will treat the transaction as not compensatory, as evidenced in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulations,
the excess of the fair market value of the property (computed without regard to the restrictions) at the time of cancellation over the sum of‚Äî
(C)the fair market value of such property (computed by taking the restriction into account) immediately before the cancellation, and
(D)the amount, if any, paid for the cancellation,
shall be treated as compensation for the taxable year in which such cancellation occurs.
(e)Applicability of section
This section shall not apply to‚Äî
(1)a transaction to which section 421 applies,
(2)a transfer to or from a trust described in section 401(a) or a transfer under an annuity plan which meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2),
(3)the transfer of an option without a readily ascertainable fair market value,
(4)the transfer of property pursuant to the exercise of an option with a readily ascertainable fair market value at the date of grant, or
(5)group-term life insurance to which section 79 applies.
(f)Holding period
In determining the period for which the taxpayer has held property to which subsection (a) applies, there shall be included only the period beginning at the first time his rights in such property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier.

(g)Certain exchanges
If property to which subsection (a) applies is exchanged for property subject to restrictions and conditions substantially similar to those to which the property given in such exchange was subject, and if section 354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036) applied to such exchange, or if such exchange was pursuant to the exercise of a conversion privilege‚Äî
(1)such exchange shall be disregarded for purposes of subsection (a), and
(2)the property received shall be treated as property to which subsection (a) applies.
(h)Deduction by employer
In the case of a transfer of property to which this section applies or a cancellation of a restriction described in subsection (d), there shall be allowed as a deduction under section 162, to the person for whom were performed the services in connection with which such property was transferred, an amount equal to the amount included under subsection (a), (b), or (d)(2) in the gross income of the person who performed such services. Such deduction shall be allowed for the taxable year of such person in which or with which ends the taxable year in which such amount is included in the gross income of the person who performed such services.

(i)Qualified equity grants
(1)In general
For purposes of this subtitle‚Äî
(A)Timing of inclusion
If qualified stock is transferred to a qualified employee who makes an election with respect to such stock under this subsection, subsection (a) shall be applied by including the amount determined under such subsection with respect to such stock in income of the employee in the taxable year determined under subparagraph (B) in lieu of the taxable year described in subsection (a).

(B)Taxable year determined
The taxable year determined under this subparagraph is the taxable year of the employee which includes the earliest of‚Äî
(i)the first date such qualified stock becomes transferable (including, solely for purposes of this clause, becoming transferable to the employer),
(ii)the date the employee first becomes an excluded employee,
(iii)the first date on which any stock of the corporation which issued the qualified stock becomes readily tradable on an established securities market (as determined by the Secretary, but not including any market unless such market is recognized as an established securities market by the Secretary for purposes of a provision of this title other than this subsection),
(iv)the date that is 5 years after the first date the rights of the employee in such stock are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier, or

(I)except as provided in subclauses (II) and (III), the determination of rights and privileges with respect to stock shall be made in a similar manner as under section 423(b)(5),
(II)employees shall not fail to be treated as having the same rights and privileges to receive qualified stock solely because the number of shares available to all employees is not equal in amount, so long as the number of shares available to each employee is more than a de minimis amount, and
(III)rights and privileges with respect to the exercise of an option shall not be treated as the same as rights and privileges with respect to the settlement of a restricted stock unit.
(iii)Employee

(I)not less than 25 percent of the total dollar amount of the stock so purchased is deferral stock, and
(II)the determination of which individuals from whom deferral stock is purchased is made on a reasonable basis.
(C)Definitions and special rules related to limitation on stock redemptions
(i)Deferral stock
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‚Äúdeferral stock‚Äù means stock with respect to which an election is in effect under this subsection.

(ii)Deferral stock with respect to any individual not taken into account if individual holds deferral stock with longer deferral period
Stock purchased by a corporation from any individual shall not be treated as deferral stock for purposes of subparagraph (B)(iii) if such individual (immediately after such purchase) holds any deferral stock with respect to which an election has been in effect under this subsection for a longer period than the election with respect to the stock so purchased.

(iii)Purchase of all outstanding deferral stock
The requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be treated as met if the stock so purchased includes all of the corporation‚Äôs outstanding deferral stock.

(iv)Reporting
Any corporation which has outstanding deferral stock as of the beginning of any calendar year and which purchases any of its outstanding stock during such calendar year shall include on its return of tax for the taxable year in which, or with which, such calendar year ends the total dollar amount of its outstanding stock so purchased during such calendar year and such other information as the Secretary requires for purposes of administering this paragraph.

(5)Controlled groups
For purposes of this subsection, all persons treated as a single employer under section 414(b) shall be treated as 1 corporation.

(6)Notice requirement
Any corporation which transfers qualified stock to a qualified employee shall, at the time that (or a reasonable period before) an amount attributable to such stock would (but for this subsection) first be includible in the gross income of such employee‚Äî
(A)certify to such employee that such stock is qualified stock, and
(B)notify such employee‚Äî
(i)that the employee may be eligible to elect to defer income on such stock under this subsection, and
(ii)that, if the employee makes such an election‚Äî
(I)the amount of income recognized at the end of the deferral period will be based on the value of the stock at the time at which the rights of the employee in such stock first become transferable or not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, notwithstanding whether the value of the stock has declined during the deferral period,
(II)the amount of such income recognized at the end of the deferral period will be subject to withholding under section 3401(i) at the rate determined under section 3402(t), and
(III)the responsibilities of the employee (as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3)(A)(ii)) with respect to such withholding.

The animal health industry became caught up in a number of patent and trademark lawsuits during the past year. In 1994, Barclay Slocum obtained patents for the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy procedure, which is used in the treatment of dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, and for the devices used in the procedure. During 2006, Slocum Enterprises filed a patent infringement suit against New Generation Devices, arguing that the Unity Cruciate Plate manufactured by New Generation infringed on the patent for the Slocum TPLO plate. However, the court never reached a decision on the issue of patent infringement, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction on the basis of the small number of plates sold in the state in which the case was filed and the information provided on a Web site maintained by Slocum Enterprises. Other patent battles waged during 2006 concerned the use of laser technology for onychectomy in cats, pet identification chips, pig vaccines, and pet ‚Äúdeshedding‚Äù tools.
&lt;/search_result&gt;
&lt;search_result id=2&gt;
In Canada, the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association brought suit against a nonveterinarian, claiming that he engaged in cutting or otherwise removing hooks from horses' teeth and floating horses' teeth with power and manual tools, provided advice and diagnoses in return for a fee, and held himself out as being qualified and willing to provide treatment with respect to these activities. The court held that the intention of the legislature in passing the Veterinary Profession Act was the protection of the public and animals and further held that monopolistic statutes serve the purpose of protecting the public. In addition, the court concluded that dentistry, at its core, relates to the health of the teeth and gums; is distinct from cosmetic and other types of care of animals; and, therefore, falls under the definition of the practice of veterinary medicine. The nonveterinarian was enjoined from providing services without a veterinarian supervising the procedures.
&lt;/search_result&gt;
&lt;search_result id=3&gt;
The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast of the United States during 2005, spurred changes to the way animals are treated during natural disasters. In 2006, Hawaii, Louisiana, and New Hampshire all enacted laws that address issues regarding the care of animals during disasters, such as providing shelters for pets and allowing service animals to be kept with the people they serve. In addition, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act during 2006, which requires state and local emergency preparedness authorities to include in their evacuation plans information on how they will accommodate household pets and service animals in case of a disaster. California passed a law that will require its Office of Emergency Services, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies involved with disaster response preparation to develop a plan for the needs of service animals, livestock, equids, and household pets in the event of a disaster or major emergency.
